# What do I need to know to help?

- If you are looking to help to with a code contribution our project uses Kotlin. 
   - You can add features,fix bugs,add tests,help on architecting the app e.t.c
- We are using MMVM architecture,so you must have an idea on how it works.
- Check out our [designs](https://www.figma.com/file/pTMEu96evnfbJuU1kq6x7S/DevStories?node-id=0%3A1) before you start working on anything(they are being updated on the go).

# How do I make a contribution?

Never made an open source contribution before? Wondering how contributions work in our project? Here's a quick rundown!

1. Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add.
   - if an issue does not exist,create one.Also add a comment that you will be working on it .Check this example [Add Home Screen](https://github.com/kibettheophilus/DevStories-Africa/issues/3).
    
2. Fork the repository. This means that you will have a copy of the repository under your-GitHub-username/repository-name.
3. Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/github-username/repository-name.git.
4. Create a new branch for your fix using git checkout -b branch-name-here.
5. Make the appropriate changes for the issue you are trying to address or the feature that you want to add.
6. Add the changes you have made, commit and push.
7. Submit a pull request to the upstream repository.
8. Title the pull request with a short description of the changes made and the issue or bug number associated with your change. For example, you can title an issue like so "Added more log outputting to resolve #4352".
9. In the description of the pull request, explain the changes that you made, any issues you think exist with the pull request you made, and any questions you have about the project.
     - It's OK if your pull request is not perfect (no pull request is), the reviewer will be able to help you fix any problems and improve it!
10. Wait for the pull request to be reviewed.
11. Make changes to the pull request if recommended.
12. Celebrate your success after your pull request is merged!
